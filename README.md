# GCP-ML-4130
The goal of this project is to predict Yelp review star ratings (on a scale of 1-5) based on various features describing user and business interactions with a multinomial logistic regression model. The model leverages attributes like user and business average ratings, total review counts, interaction scores, and business categories to make accurate predictions using the Yelp dataset.
